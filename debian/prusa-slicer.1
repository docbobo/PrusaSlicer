Slice the model and export toolpaths as G\-code.
.TP
\fB\-\-export\-obj\fR
Export the model(s) as OBJ.
.HP
\fB\-\-export\-sla\fR, \fB\-\-sla\fR Slice the model and export SLA printing layers as PNG.
.TP
\fB\-\-export\-stl\fR
Export the model(s) as STL.
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR, \fB\-h\fR
Show this help.
.TP
\fB\-\-help\-fff\fR
Show the full list of print/G\-code configuration options.
.TP
\fB\-\-help\-sla\fR
Show the full list of SLA print configuration options.
.TP
\fB\-\-info\fR
Write information about the model to the console.
.TP
\fB\-\-save\fR ABCD
Save configuration to the specified file.
.TP
\fB\-\-slice\fR, \fB\-s\fR
Slice the model as FFF or SLA based on the printer_technology configuration
value.
.SS "Transform options:"
.TP
\fB\-\-align\-xy\fR X,Y
Align the model to the given point.
.TP
\fB\-\-center\fR X,Y
Center the print around the given center.
.TP
\fB\-\-cut\fR N
Cut model at the given Z.
.TP
\fB\-\-dont\-arrange\fR
Do not rearrange the given models before merging and keep their original XY
coordinates.
.TP
\fB\-\-duplicate\fR N
Multiply copies by this factor.
.TP
\fB\-\-duplicate\-grid\fR X,Y
Multiply copies by creating a grid.
.TP
\fB\-\-merge\fR, \fB\-m\fR
Arrange the supplied models in a plate and merge them in a single model in order
to perform actions once.
.TP
\fB\-\-repair\fR
Try to repair any non\-manifold meshes (this option is implicitly added whenever
we need to slice the model to perform the requested action).
.TP
\fB\-\-rotate\fR N
Rotation angle around the Z axis in degrees.
.TP
\fB\-\-rotate\-x\fR N
Rotation angle around the X axis in degrees.
.TP
\fB\-\-rotate\-y\fR N
Rotation angle around the Y axis in degrees.
.TP
\fB\-\-scale\fR N
Scaling factor or percentage.
.TP
\fB\-\-scale\-to\-fit\fR X,Y,Z
Scale to fit the given volume.
.TP
\fB\-\-split\fR
Detect unconnected parts in the given model(s) and split them into separate
objects.
.SS "Other options:"
.TP
\fB\-\-datadir\fR ABCD
Load and store settings at the given directory. This is useful for maintaining
different profiles or including configurations from a network storage.
.TP
\fB\-\-ignore\-nonexistent\-config\fR
Do not fail if a file supplied to \fB\-\-load\fR does not exist.
.TP
\fB\-\-load\fR ABCD
Load configuration from the specified file. It can be used more than once to
load options from multiple files.
.TP
\fB\-\-loglevel\fR N
Messages with severity lower or eqal to the loglevel will be printed out.
0:trace, 1:debug, 2:info, 3:warning, 4:error, 5:fatal
.TP
\fB\-\-output\fR ABCD, \fB\-o\fR ABCD
The file where the output will be written (if not specified, it will be based on
the input file).
